There I was in my room, my little heart pounding.

I was a seven year old Norwegian kid, a strange cassette resting in my hand:

BASIC - it said.

I didn't know it was an acronym.

I didn't even know what that English word meant.

All I knew was I had a machine with a cassette player.

And I had a cassette.

One plus one.

In it went.

Nothing.

Now what?

I yelled for my dad.

He picked up the manual, which I had ignored completely, and translated into Norwegian as he read:

"People use language to communicate with each other, and specially designed languages are also used for communication with computers. BASIC is one such language."

I could talk to the computer?

Cool!

He read on:

Set the cassette tape containing the BASIC language in the computer's data recorder.

Type in the word (l][o][a][d| and press the |CR| key. After doing this, the message PLAY appears on the screen.

Press the data recorder's | PLAY | button; the cassette tape starts moving and loading of the BASIC language begins.

After loading has been completed, the message READY is displayed and the cursor starts to blink again.


Here's the secret:

You have to fall in love with programming.

You can have all the external motivation in the world...

It will only take you that far.

Those who succeed, are the ones who fall head-over-heals in love with the process.

Only they will endure the pain.

The pain that comes from searching for a bug for hours, not being able to crush it.

The acronym: Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.

BASIC.
